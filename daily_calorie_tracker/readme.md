# Daily Calorie Tracker CLI

This is my mini project for the course "Programming for Problem Solving using Python".  
The project helps track meals and calorie intake using a simple command line interface.

## What the tool does
- Takes meal names and calorie values
- Calculates total and average calories
- Compares total with daily calorie limit
- Shows a formatted summary table
- Saves session log to a text file (optional)

## Features Implemented (As per Assignment Tasks)
1. Welcome message and project intro  
2. Input of meal names and calories  
3. Total and average calorie calculations  
4. Limit checking using if/else  
5. Neatly formatted CLI table using f-strings  
6. Bonus: Writing session data to a text file
